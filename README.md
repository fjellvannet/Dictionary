# Wadden-Sea-Dictionary
Cross-platform dictionary app for the most important Wadden Sea Words

The main purpose with this app is to help tourist guides in the Wadden Sea to guide trips for foreigners. There are many special words needed for in the Wadden Sea which can't be found in usual dictionaries (for example the names of many animals and plants). It is possible to translate between all the four Wadden Sea languages, German, English, Danish and Dutch. This application might also be interesting for tourists to understand what is being told on trips.

During my Voluntary ecological year (FÖJ, Germany) 2015/16 at the Wadden Sea Centre, in Vester Vedsted, Denmark, I have programmed this dictionary. For that, I used Qt 5.8-Open-Source. For suggestions and error-reports, send me (Lukas Neuenschwander) an e-mail (fjellvannet@gmail.com). Here you can also suggest missing words that you would like to have added to the dictionary.
